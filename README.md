# GlazeWM Info

GlazeWM is a tiling Windows Window manager (kinda funny right). It uses keyboard shortcuts to organize and move between screens. For optimal setup, consider also installing zebar.

If you've never seen a WM before, look up Hyperland. This is like that but 10x worse b/c we're on Windows.
